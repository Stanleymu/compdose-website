Use ALL of this information to create a COMPLETE and STRUCTURED summary following the exact template provided.

===== CHUNK ${index+1} ANALYSIS =====
${analysis}

Based on the above chunk analyses, create a cohesive regulatory summary that covers ALL relevant information found across the chunks.

Your summary MUST follow this EXACT template with these EXACT section headings:

Title: [Full Document Name/Number] Summary
==============================
Overview
--------
[3-5 sentences covering issuing authority, document type, purpose, scope, dates]

Main Provisions
---------------
[Bullet-point list of ALL key provisions and requirements]

Key Changes (if applicable)
-------------------------
[Changes to previous regulations, or state if none referenced]

Impact on Organizations and Individuals
---------------------------------------
[Both compliance consequences and strategies]

Monitoring and Enforcement
-------------------------
[How compliance will be monitored and enforced]

Conclusion
----------
[Significance, key takeaways, and importance]

ENSURE COMPLETENESS: Include ALL regulatory details from ALL chunks.
MAINTAIN STRUCTURE: All six sections must be present.
USE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE: Include exact dates, numbers, and requirements.
