    "The Guidance Note issued by the Financial Services Board (FSB) of South Africa on 22 November 2017 provides detailed guidance on the categorization of foreign collective investment schemes (foreign CIS), specifically hedge funds, under paragraph 5 of Board Notice 257 of 2013 and related regulations. Key points include:\n\n- The Notice sets out conditions under which a foreign CIS may solicit investments from the South African public.\n- Guidance Note 2 (December 2013) offers further direction for approval processes for foreign CIS.\n- On 25 February 2015, hedge funds were officially declared as collective investment schemes",
    "The guidance note provides criteria for categorizing a foreign Collective Investment Scheme (CIS) as a hedge fund. To be classified as such, a scheme must include strategies that could result in losses exceeding its net asset value, such as:\n\n- **Financial Derivative Instruments (FDI)**: Used for investment purposes, active strategies, or managing exposure to markets and asset classes.\n- **Complex Strategies**: Long/short, market neutral, fixed income arbitrage, option strategies, statistical arbitrage, and hedge fund index funds.\n- **Net Short Positions**: Taking positions that are net short.\n- **Complex Instruments**:",
    "The disclosures and content of the scheme particulars are fundamental in determining the appropriate categorization of a scheme or portfolio. This is because the scheme particulars—such as investment objectives, portfolio composition, and strategy—directly inform how a fund should be classified within regulatory frameworks or industry standards.\n\nFor example, mutual fund schemes are typically categorized based on their underlying asset classes (equity, debt, money market instruments) and further by investment strategies or styles (e.g., income funds, dynamic bond funds, large-cap equity funds). The classification flows from the disclosed investment objectives and portfolio details provided in the scheme particulars[5]."
